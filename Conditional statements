21. Galactic Cargo Allocation System

 Scenario:

The Interplanetary Cargo Agency (ICA)manages freight between multiple space colonies. Every cargo needs to be matched to the most suitable spacecraft based on cargo nature, priority, and destination zone. The logic must ensure efficient fleet usage and safety compliance.

There are three cargo types: Medical, Mineral, and Weapon.
Each cargo has a Priority (High/Medium/Low)and a Destination Zone— which can be Earth Orbit, Mars, Titan, or Beyond(deep-space operations).

Medical cargos are always assigned to the ship “StarLifter”, regardless of zone or priority, as they carry sensitive bio-supplies.
Mineral cargos are heavy and go to:

  “RockHauler” for Earth Orbit and Mars zones.
  “AstroFreight” for Titanor Beyondzones.
Weapon cargos have to be strictly categorized:

  High Priority→ “Defender-X”
  Medium/Low Priority→ “ShieldRunner”
Additionally, when the destination is Beyond, a 10% fuel surchargemust be added due to distance and deep-space fuel consumption.



 Test Case 1

Input:
Cargo Type: Medical
Destination Zone: Titan
Priority: High

Output:
Assigned Ship: StarLifter

Explanation:
Medical cargo always uses the StarLifter, no conditions alter that rule.



 Test Case 2

Input:
Cargo Type: Weapon
Destination Zone: Beyond
Priority: High

Output:
Assigned Ship: Defender-X
Fuel Surcharge: 10%

Explanation:
Weapon + High priority triggers Defender-X, and “Beyond” zone adds 10% surcharge.

22. Central Bank Loan Risk Evaluator

 Scenario:

The National Credit Authorityhas designed a risk evaluation system for loan applications. The applicant is rated based on Credit Score, Annual Income, Debt Ratio, and Employment History (years).
The purpose is to categorize applicants into different risk levelsto guide bank approvals.

Applicants with Credit Score < 500are automatically rejected.
Scores between 500–700are reviewed under risk categories:

  If Income < ₹25,000, they are High Risk.
  If Debt Ratio > 50%, they are Moderate Risk.
  Otherwise, they are Low Risk.
Scores above 700:

  If Employment Years < 2, status is Conditionally Approved(insufficient stability).
  Else, Approvedoutright.

 Test Case 1

Input:
Credit Score: 650
Annual Income: 30000
Debt Ratio: 60
Employment Years: 5

Output:
Loan Status: Moderate Risk

Explanation:
Credit is within 500–700 range; though income is fine, debt ratio exceeds 50%, placing the applicant in Moderate Risk.

 Test Case 2

Input:
Credit Score: 720
Annual Income: 50000
Debt Ratio: 30
Employment Years: 1

Output:
Loan Status: Conditionally Approved

23. Cyber Defense Threat Classification Engine

 Scenario:

In the National Cyber Defense Command, incoming digital threats must be immediately analyzed and classified for response. The system receives three parameters — Attack Type, Threat Level, and Network Zone— to determine defensive actions.

Attack types include: DDoS, Malware, Phishing, and Insider.
Zones are either Internal(inside organization) or External(internet-based).
Rules for action:

1. DDoS (External)→ Block Immediately.
2. Malware→ Quarantine System.
3. Phishing:

   Internal + High → Alert Management.
   External + Medium → Auto Block.
   Otherwise → Monitor Only.
4. Insider Threats:

   High → Lock User Account.
   Else → Audit and Report.



 Test Case 1

Input:
Attack Type: DDoS
Threat Level: High
Network Zone: External

Output:
Action: Block Immediately

Explanation:
External DDoS attacks are instantly blocked to prevent denial-of-service propagation.



 Test Case 2

Input:
Attack Type: Phishing
Threat Level: Medium
Network Zone: External

Output:
Action: Auto Block

Explanation:
External medium-level phishing attempts are directly blocked by the system.

24. Metro Smart Fare & Access Controller

 Scenario:

The City Metro Authoritywants an intelligent fare calculation system for passengers using modern passes.
Every passenger has:

Type:Student / Regular / SeniorCitizen
Travel Time:Peak (7–10 AM, 5–8 PM) or OffPeak

 Test Case 2

Input:
Passenger Type: SeniorCitizen
Travel Time: OffPeak
Zones: 3
Pass Type: QR

Output:
Total Fare: ₹15.00

Explanation:
Base = 3×10 = ₹30 → -50% Senior = ₹15 → No other discounts apply.
