 Scenario: Supermart Billing with Discount Rules

You are asked to build a simple billing system for a supermarket.

The system should:

 Accept a customer name and amount of purchase.
 Calculate the total amount after applying discount logic:

   If the purchase is above ₹1000, apply a 10% discount.
   If the purchase is between ₹500–₹1000, apply 5% discount.
   Below ₹500, no discount.
 Also, add a fixed tax (e.g., 18% GST) to the discounted amount.
 Finally, display the customer name, original amount, discounted amount, tax added, and final amount to be paid.


 Your Task:

You must:

 Decide which variables should be:

   Static (shared for all)
   Instance (unique to each customer)
   Local (temporary inside methods)
 Decide how many methods are needed:

   One for calculating discount?
   One for adding tax?
   One to display bill?

 Hints for Implementation (Think Before You Code!):

 Is the GST rate same for all customers? Should it be static?
 Is discount logic calculated every time based on individual customer?
 What values are only needed temporarily in calculations?
 How should you design methods — one big method, or multiple smaller ones?



 Expected Output Format:


Customer: Riya
Original Amount: ₹1200
Discount Applied: ₹120
Amount after Discount: ₹1080
Tax (18%): ₹194.4
Final Amount to Pay: ₹1274.4
